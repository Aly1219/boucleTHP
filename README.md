**They are some nice exercices to learn ruby**

#the 1st# is a little exercice to learn the method


#the 2nd# is an other exercice who ask you how long do you want the pyramid and it built it
          I did'nt succed on the last one "wtf pyramid" but I will come back to it soon
	  
	  
#the 3nd# is a programme who ask you to create a password and after that it ask you to enter it again until you 
	  enter the right password
	  
	  
#the 4th# was a fucking boulshit^^ it's a game you have to roll a dice, if you get 1 you go back, 2,3 or 4 you 
	  stay where you are, and 5 or 6 you go up. Then, when you come to the 6th stare you win. But 
	  it doesn't play and I'm tired so... an other time
